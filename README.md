## Python program to solve the assignment problem using Hungarian method

## [Hungarian Assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm "Wiki")

__Prerequisite__:
1) 
   We need to have python installed on your Windows/Linux machine. Just like we need a compiler for C++, we need the    
   python interpreter installed. It is pre-installed on linux.

Usage:

1) Use the input files present in the Testcases folder or 
   generate a new file with the following standards:
   
        N M
        A1 A2 A3 ...... AM
        B1 B2 B3 ...... BM
        ..................
        ..................
        ..................
        N1 N2 N2 ...... NM
   
    
   Where __N__ are the number of rows in the matrix and __M__ are the columns.

    Once the input file, say inputFile, is prepared run the program as follows:

  ```python
    $ python assignmentProb.py inputFile
  ```

 2)  Or you can simply use the already created 14 testcases using   
 
  ```python
    $ python assignmentProb.py TestCases/A/inputA
  ```
