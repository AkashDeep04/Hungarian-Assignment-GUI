 Zeros are located at follows: (3, 2) (0, 0) (3, 3) (3, 1) (2, 1) (1, 0)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0

  The assignments are as follows:
	 At:  3 2  Value:  24
	 At:  0 0  Value:  20
	 At:  2 1  Value:  17

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [0, 1]
 Ticked cols:   [0]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   3
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough

 New Zeros are located at follows: (3, 2) (1, 3) (3, 3) (3, 1) (2, 1) (0, 0) (1, 0) (0, 2)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  4
