 Zeros are located at follows: (3, 2) (1, 3) (4, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (4, 1) (0, 2)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  4
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 4
	Vertical line through column : 2

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  2 0  Value:  13
	 At:  3 2  Value:  17
	 At:  1 3  Value:  6
	 At:  4 4  Value:  13

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [0, 3]
 Ticked cols:   [2]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   4
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 4
	Vertical line through column : 2

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough
 Now going for uncovering elements pass
