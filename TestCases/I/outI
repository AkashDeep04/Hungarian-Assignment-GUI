 Zeros are located at follows: (0, 1) (1, 2) (0, 0) (2, 2)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  2
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Vertical line through column : 2

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  0 1  Value:  15
	 At:  1 2  Value:  19

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [1, 2]
 Ticked cols:   [2]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   2
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Vertical line through column : 2

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough

 New Zeros are located at follows: (0, 1) (1, 2) (0, 0) (1, 1) (2, 2)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 2

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  0 0  Value:  25
	 At:  1 1  Value:  20
	 At:  2 2  Value:  17

 Current solution is optimal and the minimal cost:  62
