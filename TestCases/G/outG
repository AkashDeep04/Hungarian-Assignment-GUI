 Zeros are located at follows: (3, 1) (2, 3) (2, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  4
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  1 0  Value:  6
	 At:  3 1  Value:  9
	 At:  2 3  Value:  8
	 At:  0 4  Value:  7

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [1, 4]
 Ticked cols:   [0]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   4
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0
