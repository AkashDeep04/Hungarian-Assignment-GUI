 Zeros are located at follows: (0, 1) (1, 2) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) (4, 1) (2, 4)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Vertical line through column : 1

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  0 1  Value:  5
	 At:  1 2  Value:  6
	 At:  2 0  Value:  3

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [0, 3, 4]
 Ticked cols:   [1]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Vertical line through column : 1

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough
 Now going for uncovering elements pass
