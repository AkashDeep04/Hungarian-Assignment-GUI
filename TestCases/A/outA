 Zeroes are located at follows: (1, 2) (2, 0) (0, 0) (1, 1) (3, 3)

 Current best combination to cover all zeroes:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0

  The assignments are as follows:
	 At:  1 2  Value:  9
	 At:  2 0  Value:  4
	 At:  3 3  Value:  3

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [0, 2]
 Ticked cols:   [0]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 0

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough
 Now going for uncovering elements pass
