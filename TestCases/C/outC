 Zeros are located at follows: (3, 0) (3, 3) (2, 2) (0, 2) (1, 1)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 2

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  3 0  Value:  8
	 At:  1 1  Value:  37
	 At:  2 2  Value:  5

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [0, 2]
 Ticked cols:   [2]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   3
	Horizontal line through row : 1
	Horizontal line through row : 3
	Vertical line through column : 2

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough
