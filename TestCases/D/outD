 Zeros are located at follows: (0, 1) (3, 0) (2, 2) (1, 0) (0, 3) (0, 2)

 Current best combination to cover all zeros:  3
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Vertical line through column : 0

  The assignments are as follows: 
	 At:  0 1  Value:  75
	 At:  3 0  Value:  45
	 At:  2 2  Value:  90

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough


 Ticked rows:   [1, 3]
 Ticked cols:   [0]

 Marking unmarked rows and marked cols:   3
	Horizontal line through row : 0
	Horizontal line through row : 2
	Vertical line through column : 0

 Current solution isn't optimal as lines are not enough
 Now going for uncovering elements pass
